# Maxbotix_Ultrasonic

An example is provided with a simple function to read through serial pin (pin5) of Maxbotix ultrasonic sensor. Serial pin is the most accurate output of Maxbotix sensors (source: pin5 description of sensor [datasheet](https://www.maxbotix.com/documents/HRXL-MaxSonar-WR_Datasheet.pdf), usually page 2).
The example is self-explanatory and easy to follow.  
It is tested and working with HRXL sensor and is supposed to work with other models as long as serial output pattern is the same.
